# Beefmote client
An Android client for the [Beefmote server plugin](https://github.com/lgvaioli/beefmote).

# What's this?
This is an Android client for a [DeaDBeeF](https://github.com/DeaDBeeF-Player/deadbeef) remote control server I wrote. You can control DeaDBeeF from your Android phone with this.

# How do I install it?
Until I get around to signing the app's apk and whatnot, the only way to install this is to compile it yourself with Android Studio.

# How do I use it?
Just open the program, type in the IP and port (49160 by default) where the Beefmote server plugin is running, and tap "Connect".
